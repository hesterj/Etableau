<H3>Architecture</H3>

E 2.1pre [Sch02,Sch13] is a purely equational theorem prover for
many-sorted first-order logic with equality.  It consists of an
(optional) clausifier for pre-processing full first-order formulae
into clausal form, and a saturation algorithm implementing an instance
of the superposition calculus with negative literal selection and a
number of redundancy elimination techniques.  E is based on the
DISCOUNT-loop variant of the <EM>given-clause</EM> algorithm, i.e., a
strict separation of active and passive facts. No special rules for
non-equational literals have been implemented.  Resolution is
effectively simulated by paramodulation and equality resolution.
<P>
For the SLH and LTB divisions, a control program uses a SInE-like
analysis to extract reduced axiomatizations that are handed to several
instances of E. E will probably not use on-the-fly learning this year.


<H3>Strategies</H3>

Proof search in E is primarily controlled by a literal selection
strategy, a clause selection heuristic, and a simplification
ordering. The prover supports a large number of pre-programmed literal
selection strategies. Clause selection heuristics can be constructed
on the fly by combining various parameterized primitive evaluation
functions, or can be selected from a set of predefined
heuristics. Clause evaluation heuristics are based on symbol-counting,
but also take other clause properties into account. In particular, the
search can prefer clauses from the set of support, or containing many
symbols also present in the goal. Supported term orderings are several
parameterized instances of Knuth-Bendix-Ordering (KBO) and
Lexicographic Path Ordering (LPO).
<P>
For CASC-26, E implements a strategy-scheduling automatic mode.  The
total CPU time available is broken into several (unequal) time
slices. For each time slice, the problem is classified into one of
several classes, based on a number of simple features (number of
clauses, maximal symbol arity, presence of equality, presence of
non-unit and non-Horn clauses,...). For each class, a schedule of
strategies is greedily constructed from experimental data as follows:
The first strategy assigned to a schedule is the the one that solves
the most problems from this class in the first time slice. Each
subsequent strategy is selected based on the number of solutions on
problems not already solved by a preceding strategy.
<p>
About 220 different strategies have been evaluated on all untyped
first-order problems from TPTP 6.4.0. About 90 of these
strategies are used in the automatic mode, and about 210 are used in
at least one schedule.


<H3>Implementation</H3>

E is build around perfectly shared terms, i.e. each distinct term is
only represented once in a term bank. The whole set of terms thus
consists of a number of interconnected directed acyclic graphs.  Term
memory is managed by a simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector.
Unconditional (forward) rewriting using unit clauses is implemented
using perfect discrimination trees with size and age constraints.
Whenever a possible simplification is detected, it is added as a
rewrite link in the term bank. As a result, not only terms, but also
rewrite steps are shared.  Subsumption and contextual literal cutting
(also known as subsumption resolution) is supported using feature
vector indexing [Sch04].  Superposition and backward rewriting use
fingerprint indexing [Sch12], a new technique combining ideas from
feature vector indexing and path indexing.  Finally, LPO and KBO are
implemented using the elegant and efficient algorithms developed by
Bernd L&ouml;chner in [Loe06,Loe06].  The prover and additional
information are available at

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

E 2.1pre has slightly better strategies than previous versions, and
has some minor improvements in clausification and Set-of-Support
implementation. The system is expected to perform well in most proof
classes, but will at best complement top systems in the disproof
classes.
