This file contains notes on potential porting problems for E.

* Compilation with other compilers
    
  E is tested during development with gcc and clang on Linux and
  Mac OS X. If you do not have access to gcc, but have a proprietary
  C99 compiler, you need to adjust the build process as follows:

   - set these variables in Makefile.vars:
    - CC to your C compiler (usually cc)
    - CFLAGS to the proper options for your compiler
    - MAKEDEPEND to use makedepend instead of the compiler
   - execute ./configure
   - execute ./make

* Since some of the conceptual set and bag operations are indeed
  implemented as set and bag operations, the order in which some
  operations are performed may depend on the addresses your C
  library hands out for malloc()ed blocks. This will effect the
  exact behaviour of the prover on a per run basis.
