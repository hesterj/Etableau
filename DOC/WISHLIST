This is what I think should be done to improve the prover
significantly. If you have more suggestions, feel free to send them to
schulz@informatik.tu-muenchen.de. There is also a TODO file that
should remind me of things I have to work on (and which is usually
out of sync).

There are two projects that can be separated from the main prover
pretty well:

- Automatic generation of term orderings (very partially done, talk to
  me if you want to do something in this direction)
