Etableau is a first order theorem prover for first order logic based 
on Eprover, using it as a library.  Etableau combines the superposition
calculus and the clausal tableaux calculus in a novel way, using the
tableaux calculus to generate lemmas and new assumptions that can be 
used to find contradictions in certain situations.

Etableau is licensed and installed in the same way as Eprover.

To install Etableau, clone this repository, execute the following commands.

    ./configure
    make rebuild
    
The executable "eprover" is generated in the PROVER directory.  To check that it worked,
try running ./eprover --tableau=1 --tableau-depth=10 $1, where $1 is some TPTP problem file.

--tableau=1 enables clausal tableaux proof search.

--tableau-depth=10 sets the maximum depth of a tableaux during proof search to 10.
This number can be changed as desired.

--tableau-saturation=1 enables the combination of the superposition calculus and tableaux
calculus.

--tableau-dot-print=dir prints DOT graphs of the closed tableau found in a successful proof 
search to the directory dir.

--apr=3 filters the axiom specification to only include clauses within an alternating
path relevance distance of 3 from the conjectures of the specification.  This number can 
be changed.  This option is not recommended except on the largest problems.

--quicksat=100 ensures that no more than 100 clauses are processed during saturation of
tableau branches.  This number can be changed.  The default value is 100 if the option
--quicksat is passed without an integer option.

--tableau-equality=1 introduces equality axioms for the symbols found in the specification
as well as axioms of symmetry, reflection, and transitivity.  This is helpful on some
problems.  

Options controlling the saturation procedure of Eprover also work, allowing the user 
to use different strategies.
